I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University, working with Prof. Juanzi Li. Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree from Shanxi University in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. Ru Li. I have published several papers in top-tier conferences such as WWW, AAAI, ICLR, ACL, EMNLP, COLING and so on.


My research interests broadly lie in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Knowledge Engineering**. Specifically, I focus on the following four directions:

- **Intelligent Agents**: Aim to build agents with multi-modal perception, autonomous decision-making, natural language interaction, and complex task planning capabilities. Explore methods to improve cross-domain collaboration and continual learning, enabling efficient integration of intelligent systems into real-world applications.

- **Knowledge Acquisition**: Leverage large language models to extract complex structured knowledge from natural language, and optimize model behavior for large-scale, high-precision knowledge acquisition.

- **Knowledge Application**: Enhance the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs through knowledge integration, mitigate hallucinations, and support effective deployment in vertical domains.

- **Model Mechanism Analysis**: Investigate model behaviors and outputs to better understand internal mechanisms, improve models at a fundamental level, and provide interpretable and trustworthy support for predictions.
